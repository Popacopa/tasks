# List Task

This folder contains the implementation of a linked list data structure and related operations.

## Files

- `grath_type.hpp`: Contains the class definition and implementation of the `Graph` class, along with various methods such as `addEdge`, `print`, and others.

## Classes

- **Graph**: Implements a graph with methods to manipulate the graph such as adding edges and printing the graph.

## Key Methods

- `addEdge(int from, int to)`: Adds an edge between two vertices.
- `print()`: Prints the graph.

## Usage

To use the graph, include `grath_type.hpp` in your project and create an instance of the `Graph` class. You can then call its methods to perform various operations on the graph.

## Example
